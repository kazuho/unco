=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Unco is a wrapper program that records the changes made to files by programs so
that they can be undone laterwards.

It uses a technique called library preloading (for more information consult the
linux documents with keyword LD_PRELOAD, or os x document with keyword
DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES) to trap the library calls that affect the files, and
records the changes made by the programs being executed.

=head1 INSTALLATION

 cmake .
 make
 make install
